### Introduction

This is a simple app to build a control panel for web application with manage users and set rights users groups with UI using cpanel theme and Bootstrap for CSS. You can get it as skeleton of a control panel for a web application and write more modules for this by using Laravel 4.2.
For simpler, I have not yet included Laravel framework, so you need add it by yourself and use /app/database/user_rights.sql to setup database for this.

### Requirement
- PHP 5.4+ and Laravel framework 4.2 to run.
- Knowledge about building web app from Laravel framework.
